Stat-585-Project
================

In this project, I will be creating a shiny app for the career services at Iowa State. It will include a dynamic map that shows all the people placed in the displayed area and be able to filter out employment based on college and major. I will be using data from the LAS, Business, and Design Career Services to populate the map.
